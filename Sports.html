                <p>As the coronavirus spreads in Japan, the chief executive of the Tokyo Games said Friday he can't guarantee the postponed Olympics will be staged next year even with a 16-month delay.
                  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued an emergency declaration this week to battle the virus, putting the country under restrictions after it seemed it had avoided the spread.                  I don't think anyone would be able to say if it is going to be possible to get it under control by next July or not," Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said, speaking through an interpreter at a news conference conducted remotely.</p>

                <p>Australia vice-captain Pat Cummins said Australia players were keen on playing 'less aggressively' after the repercussions of the ball-tampering scandal that dented the image of cricket in the country.

Clarke said Australia went too soft on Kohli and his Indian teammates in a bid to save their Indian Premier League (IPL) contracts</p>
