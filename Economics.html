                <p>April 10, 2020 UPDATED: April 10, 2020 12:08 IST</p>

                  In a call, Asakawa commended the Indian government's decisive response to the pandemic, including a national health emergency program, tax and other relief measures provided to businesses and a USD 23 billion (Rs 1.7 lakh crore) economic relief package announced on March 26 to provide immediate income and consumption support to the poor, women, and workers affected by the three-week nationwide lockdown.</p>

                <p>PEC, Russia and other allies outlined plans on Thursday to cut their oil output by more than a fifth and said they expected the United States and other producers to join in their effort to prop up prices hammered by the coronavirus crisis.
                 But the group, known as OPEC+, said a final agreement was dependent on Mexico signing up to the pact after it balked at the production cuts it was asked to make. Discussions among top global energy ministers will resume on Friday.</p>

                <p>April 10, 2020 UPDATED: April 9, 2020 18:23 IST</p>
                <p>The year 2020 could see the worst global economic fallout since the Great Depression in the 1930s with over 170 countries likely to experience negative per capita income growth due to the raging coronavirus pandemic, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday.

                <p>he Indian rupee settled 6 paise higher at 76.28 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday tracking higher equities.
                  The local unit had settled at an all-time low of 76.34 against the greenback on Wednesday.                  
                  Forex traders said the rupee traded in a narrow range as higher opening in domestic equities supported the local unit while concerns over coronavirus outbreak weighed on the local unit.
                  At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 76.11, but witnessed heavy volatility and touched a low of 76.55 against the American currency.</p>

                <p>European Union finance ministers agreed on Thursday on half-a-trillion euros worth of support for their coronavirus-battered economies but left open the question of how to finance recovery in the bloc headed for a steep recession.
                  The agreement was reached after EU powerhouse Germany, as well as France, put their feet down to end opposition from the Netherlands over attaching economic conditions to emergency credit for governments weathering the impacts of the pandemic, and offered Italy assurances that the bloc would show solidarity.</p>
