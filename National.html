                <h3>Veteran Telugu actor Narsing Yadav hospitalised, put on ventilator</h3>
                <p>April 10, 2020UPDATED: April 10, 2020 12:47 IST</p>
                <p>Veteran Telugu actor Narsing Yadav, who has been part of more than 300 films, has been admitted to a private hospital in Somajiguda, Hyderabad, where he slipped into coma.
                  According to reports, the actor collapsed all of a sudden on Thursday (April 9) evening at his residence. His wife, Chitra Yadav, rushed him to a private hospital nearby, where he is put on ventilator and is currently being treated by a team of doctors.                  There were also speculations that the actor fell from the steps and hit his head on a hard surface, which could be why he fell unconscious. However, Chitra Yadav denied it as a baseless rumour and requested people to pray for him.</p>
