                <p>April 9, 2020 UPDATED: April 9, 2020 12:16 IST</p>
                <p>Tech giant Google has issued a ban on the use of the Zoom videoconferencing app for all its employees citing security concerns. Zoom witnessed a surge in popularity as it gave people a platform to socialize and carry out their professional work seamlessly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                  As per a report published in BuzzFeed News, Google sent a mail to its employees last week, informing them that the videoconferencing app will no longer function in their corporate laptops and desktops.</p>

                <h3>Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 to be cheaper as Samsung finds a simple way to cut costs</h3>
                <p>April 8, 2020 UPDATED: April 8, 2020 13:56 IST</p>
                <p>Samsung stunned us all last year with the Galaxy Fold and this year, it followed its trend of selling a folding phone with the Galaxy Z Flip. The big change from the last year’s model, apart from the form factor, was the difference in price. Hence, Samsung was able to sell the Galaxy Z Flip in truckloads, despite it being an expensive phone by all means. It seems that Samsung wants to follow this formula for its upcoming folding smartphone later this year.</p>

                <h3>Don’t use Zoom for video calls, Taiwan tells govt agencies</h3>
                <p>April 8, 2020 UPDATED: April 8, 2020 16:15 IST</p><br>
                <p>In yet another blow to the popular video-conferencing appZoom, the Taiwan cabinet has now imposed a ban on the usage of the app owing to the security concerns that have surfaced recently. The cabinet has asked all the government agencies to stop using the app. Despite a surge in popularity, Zoom has been under the scanner for its flawed privacy policies.
                  Zoom’s popularity rocketed during the lockdown period and it had over 200 million active users in March. But a lot of security flaws were uncovered recently and due to which Zoom had even announced a feature freeze for 90 days to focus on its shortcomings. Issues such as lack of end-to-end encryptions, zoombombing were discovered recently.</p>

                <p>April 8, 2020 UPDATED: April 8, 2020 10:15 IST</p>
                <p>While the parents are working from home due to the worldwide lockdown, the kids who have hardly any errands to do, are spending more and more time watching videos on streaming apps like Netflix. Now that the kids have the complete control of the app, there are fair chances that they would explore beyond the kids' section and might end up watching a series that is not appropriate for them. Well, worry no more as Netflix has introduced a new set of parental controls that allows parents to keep a tab of what their kids are watching. You can also block certain shows, series, and movies from the list if you think it is not suitable for your kids</p>

                <p>We were recently treated to reports of Xiaomi working on a smartphone with a massive 144-megapixel lens, however, it appears the company could be looking to do one better in the coming days.
                  As per a new report by leakster Digital Chat Station, a Chinese phone maker -- possibly Xiaomi in partnership with Samsung -- is working on a Snapdragon 765G based smartphone that could have a 192-megapixel primary camera sensor.
                  While the leakster doesn't reveal any other information about the phone, he does mention that more information will be available next month, while also letting his followers know, "it won’t be the phone you expect."</p>              </div>
