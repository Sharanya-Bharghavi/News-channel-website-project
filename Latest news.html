                <h3>Corornavirus Outbreak: Schools, colleges likely to remain close after April 14</h3>
                <p>April 10, 2020UPDATED: April 10, 2020 13:33 IST</p>
                <p>We have now 6000 plus novel coronavirus cases in India. With the ongoing Pan-India lockdown and all other restrictions, the outbreak is spreading like a wildfire. In the midst of the ongoing outbreak, Prime Minister Modi on Wednesday hinted that the Centre in all likelihood will be extending the nationwide lockdown that is supposed to end on April 14. PM Modi reportedly said that he would consult with Chief Ministers but by all accounts the lifting of the lockdown is not possibleâ€™. And if that happens, then automatically, schools and colleges will also remain closed for a longer period of time.</p>

                <p>April 10, 2020 UPDATED: April 10, 2020 12:00 IST</p><br>
                <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday told Israel and Brazil that India is ready to do whatever is possible to help its friends in the fight against the novel coronavirus.
                  Modi made the remarks after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro thanked New Delhi for allowing the export of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the raw materials to produce it.
                  The drug has been cited by many as a viable therapeutic solution to fight the coronavirus infection.</p>

                <h3>Pope guides locked-down world through virtual Easter</h3>
                <p>April 10, 2020UPDATED: April 10, 2020 12:19 IST</p>
                <p>Church doors will be shut and the Vatican sealed off when Pope Francis leads 1.3 billion Catholics in Easter Sunday celebrations held under a worldwide coronavirus lockdown.
                  Fear and confusion in the face of a disease whose toll has unrelentingly climbed towards 100,000 are reshaping society and transforming the way religion is observed.
                  Even such hallowed traditions as the pope's messages to the faithful on Saint Peter's Square are being replaced by livestreamed prayers that Francis reluctantly records from the seclusion of his private library.
                  The Vatican has been closed to visitors for a month and the 83-year-old pontiff -- beloved for breaking stuffy customs and mingling with the people -- has complained of feeling "caged".</p>

                <p>April 10, 2020UPDATED: April 10, 2020 12:55 IST</p><br>
                <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers of all states on Saturday via video, where a call would be taken on whether the 21-day lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, ending next week, should be extended.
                 The video conference comes amidst indications that the central government may extend the lockdown across the country beyond April 14 after several states have favoured the extension to contain the fast-spreading virus.</p>

                <p>The Wadhawan brothers, wanted by the CBI and ED in the Yes Bank fraud case, had rented a guesthouse in Khandala to evade probe agencies before they were detained at Mahabaleshwar on Thursday for violating prohibitory orders amid lockdown.
                  Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan were in hiding since March 8 after Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor was arrested by the ED in a case related to suspicious loans granted by the bank and alleged quid pro quo to Kapoor's family companies for these loans.</p>
