# News-channel-website-project
This is made as part of project submission of CSE-326

1>INTRODUCTION

In hush and rush of this era, who really finds time to open and read newspapers in English. Also in TV, nowadays we find debates and discussions more than amount of news content they provide. Also the people in modern world want everything a click away. So here we intend to create a news channel website which provides constants updates of the happenings across the globe.

2> BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNED PROJECT

News broadcasting is the medium of broadcasting of various news events and other information via television, radio, or internet in the field of broadcast journalism. The content is usually either produced locally in a radio studio or television studio newsroom, or by a broadcast network. It may also include additional material such as sports coverage weather forecasts, traffic reports, commentary, and other material that the broadcaster feels is relevant to their audience. But here we are talking about an online website of A news channel.
Digital technology presents an often-bewildering array of choices for journalists – producing slideshows and video, joining social networks and blogging, using map mashups and mobile devices. The list seems endless.
OBJECTIVE :-
 This is the website for news channel from where the viewers can see Latest news, top news, international, videos, subscription, trending news, home for their social awareness and necessity. An online newspaper is the online version of a newspaper, either as a stand-alone publication or as the online version of a printed periodical.


APPLICATIONS :-
 From the website viewers can go through the breaking news in a more timely manner.  The credibility and strong brand recognition of well-established newspapers depends on the close relationships they have with advertisers, because this is one of the most important things for their chances of survival in the newspaper industry. The movement away from the printing process can also help decrease costs. This kind of news channel website comes with many features which is pretty good for handling a large amount of people. the features are like 24/7 updates, more news choices, in-depth and background information, customization, the existence of different viewpoints.

Advantages of online News:-
As more people consume news online, news organizations face the dilemma of reallocating resources to attract new readers and viewers while still trying to hold on to their existing, and usually aging, print or broadcast audiences.
Online revenues for most news media are still a small fraction of the income from traditional print or broadcast. And after many years of double-digit annual increases in online advertising revenue, the trend tapered off dramatically in 2008 and 2009, with online revenues flat or even decreasing.
For newspapers, typically 15 percent or less of total revenues come from online operations (although the Los Angeles Times reported in late 2008 that online income was enough to pay for the paper’s entire print and online news staffs).
Magazines similarly get less than 10 percent of their revenue from their digital operations according to an Advertising Age survey of 2008 revenues.
Financial viability for newspapers and most magazines, at least for now, requires retaining as many existing print readers as possible.
Yet the trends are clear: people, especially the young, are turning to the Internet for more and more of their news and developing an effective digital strategy is essential for long-term survival.
